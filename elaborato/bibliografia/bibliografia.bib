applying machine learning to determine a function that models the data set the Bloom

outcomes: (1) we clarify what guarantees can and cannot be associated with such a
structure; (2) we show how to estimate what size the learning function must obtain
in order to obtain improved performance; (3) we provide a simple method, sandwiching,
for optimizing learned Bloom filters; and (4) we propose a design and analysis approach
for a learned Bloomier filter, based on our modeling approach.},

abstract = {A Bloom filter is a simple space-efficient randomized data structure for representing
a set in order to support membership queries. Although Bloom filters allow false positives,
for many applications the space savings outweigh this draw-back when the probability
of an error is sufficiently low. We introduce compressed Bloom filters, which improve
performance when the Bloom filter is passed as a message, and its transmission size
is a limiting factor. For example, Bloom filters have been suggested as a means for
sharing Web cache information. In this setting, proxies do not share the exact contents
of their caches, but instead periodically broadcast Bloom filters representing their
cache. By using compressed Bloom filters, proxies can reduce the number of bits broadcast,
the false positive rate, and/or the amount of computation per lookup. The cost is
the processing time for compression and decompression, which can use simple arithmetic
coding, and more memory use at the proxies, which utilize the larger uncompressed
form of the Bloom filter.},
